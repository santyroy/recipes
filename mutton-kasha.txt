Ingredients:
    Mutton- 1 kg (medium sized pieces with bone)
    Onion- 2 medium sized (grated)
    Cumin powder- 1  Tablespoon
    green chilies- 4-5
    Salt (to taste)
    Ginger paste- 1 tbsp
    Garlic paste- 1 tsp
    Sugar- 1/2 tsp
    Garam masala powder- ¼ tsp
    Mustard oil- 1/4 cup (half a cup is enough..choose your mutton with some fat..adds to the flavor)

To marinade :
    Raw papaya- ¼ cup (grated) (This is crucial because the enzymes in the papaya will make the meat softer and tender)
    Kashmiri chilli powder- ½ tsp
    Turmeric powder- ½ tsp
    Salt – ½ teaspoon
    Sugar - ½ teaspoon
    Thick yogurt/curd- ¾ cup

Method:

    Marinade the mutton pieces with all the ingredients mentioned ‘For marinating the Mutton’. Keep aside for 5 hours.(you can keep it in fridge overnight. The longer the better!)

    Heat oil in a deep frying Kadai (or any deep pan). Add all the items under “ Tempering’.
    Now the onions till it’s light brown in coulour. Add ginger-garlic paste, mix and sauté for few seconds. Next to add Cumin powder, mix and fry for few seconds again.

    Now add marinated mutton into this. Add yogurt, salt and green chilies.

    Mix and cook on medium flame for 15-20 minutes uncovered. Keep stirring.
    Add one cup of hot water into the mutton. Mix well, cover and cook on low flame until cooked thoroughly. It took me about 40-45 minutes on low flame. Keep checking every 15-20 minutes to make sure you don’t over-cook your meat. It depends on a lot of factors – the meat quality, amount, etc.

    When the mutton pieces are fully cooked check salt, add sugar and garam masala powder, mix well and remove from heat.
